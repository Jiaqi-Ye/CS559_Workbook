# CS559 Workbook, Spring 2026

This set of web pages forms a "workbook" assignment for 
CS559, Computer Graphics at the University of Wisconsin for Fall 2026.

Students should run a local web server and start with the `index.html` page.
The html files may not work as "files" without a local server.

We recommend opening the folder in Visual Studio Code and starting
Live server.

Information about the class is available on the course web:
https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp26/

The `for_students` sub-directory contains files for the students to read and
modify.

The `libs` sub-directory contains libraries used by the workbook. These
have separate open source licenses provided in the directories.

The `docs` sub-directory contains the content pages that students read.
Students should not need to look at the files (other than through the
web server).

The `js` sub-directory are javascript code that make the web pages work.
Students should not need to look at these.

The workbook content was primarily developed by Prof. Michael Gleicher with
assistance from the course staff, including Young Wu, over the years.

Students are granted the right to use the workbook content for their work
in class.
